# ybench: a benchmark for fungal sequence-to-expression models

![image](img/readme_banner.svg)

`ybench` is a comprehensive set of eleven tasks to benchmark yeast-focussed sequence-to-function (S2F) models like Shorkie and Yorzoi. Each task covers a different part of the genome's regulatory complexity from eQTLs, promoter/UTR/terminator [MPRAs](https://www.google.com/search?q=mpra+massively+parallel+reporter+assay), reporter gene insertions in different genomic locations to investigate context effects as well as exogenous but linearised bacterial DNA in yeast and structurally rearranged chromosomes.

## Results

Winner on each benchmark's primary metric (full per-metric tables in
[docs/results.md](docs/results.md)). Kita, Brooks and Meneu carry Modal runs from
2026-07-31; Lee YTK carries a Modal run from 2026-08-25. The other benchmarks'
numbers are from earlier local runs.

## Quickstart

Install the framework with every model's dependencies, fetch the data, then run
the canonical `configs/default.yaml`:

```bash
uv sync --extra all                                   # framework + all models + data backend
uv run ybench data get --config configs/default.yaml  # download data + weights
uv run ybench run --config configs/default.yaml       # score every (model, task) pair
```

Results land in `results/default/<model>__<task>/`. For everything else — the
other models, partial data pulls, GPU selection, every flag, and the output
layout — see the [CLI reference](docs/cli.md).

## Architecture

Models and benchmarks don't import each other. They connect through small
**protocol** interfaces: a benchmark says which method it needs a model to
provide, and each model provides that method separately.

- A **benchmark** (one per task, in `src/yeastbench/benchmarks/`) declares the
  single protocol it needs, then implements `evaluate` / `plot` /
  `save_results`. It never refers to a specific model.
- A **protocol** (`src/yeastbench/adapters/protocols.py`) is a one-method
  interface for a capability a task needs — e.g. `score_variants` (eQTLs),
  `predict_expression_scores` (MPRAs), `predict_coverage_batch` (RNA-seq tracks).
- An **adapter** (`src/yeastbench/adapters/`) implements one protocol for one
  model by wrapping its forward pass. It never refers to a specific task.
- A **registry** (`src/yeastbench/registry.py`) maps names to tasks and models,
  and the `ybench` CLI connects them:

  ```
  task    = TASKS[task_name](...)               # e.g. caudal_eqtl
  adapter = MODELS[model_name](task, device)    # the model's adapter for task's protocol
  task.evaluate(adapter) → save_results → plot
  ```

Because tasks and models only depend on the protocol in between, adding a model
means writing one adapter per protocol it supports — not one per task. And a new
task that reuses an existing protocol needs no model changes at all. See
[docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md) for the step-by-step.
